            <p>Hi all! My name is Mike Hanna. <br> <br>I am currently attending a full-stack web development course through the University Of Pennsylvania. As I work through this course and learn many more valuable skills, I am looking forward to filling this site with my projects and creations along the way.</p>
            <p>I am currently a full-time operations manager for an industry-leading research firm. I love what I do, but I have an insatiable desire to keep learning and growing outside of my comfort zone, which is exactly why I am learning full-stack development!</p>
            <p>In my spare time (little though it may be), I like working creatively with my hands. I have been playing guitar for 22 years, which led to some of the best years of my life touring around the western hemisphere with my bands and meeting tons of interesting people. I also like to disassemble and mod electronics. Give me a good soldering iron and I'll make magic! I also have spent time learning how to make little useful toys out of Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits. I see web development as the next new creative skill I plan to see flowing from my fingertips.</p>
            <p>Some useless facts about me:</p>
            <ul>    
                <li>- I am unusually proud of being left-handed</li> 
                <li>- I can work seasons 3 through 8 of The Simpsons into any conversation</li> 
                <li>- I have a dog named after a Harry Potter character</li> 
                <li>- I own over a thousand retro video game cartridges/discs as well as systems that were made between the 1970s up to the early 2000s</li> 
                <li>-I've seen every MCU movie in the theater on its Thursday night premiere since the beginning (yes, that includes The Incredible Hulk)</li>
                <li>- I am distantly related to two U.S. Presidents</li>
            </ul>
